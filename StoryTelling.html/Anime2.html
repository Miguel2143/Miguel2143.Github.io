		<p>This fight scene is from the critically acclaimed 2004 anime called "Samurai Champloo". The reckless behavior of the character "Mugen" and the juxtaposing calmness/precision of the Secondary character "Jin" mix so beautifully. This Fight Start because of Mugens morbid curiousity to face the most skilled samurai meanwhile Jin simply just walked into the restaurant. </p>
