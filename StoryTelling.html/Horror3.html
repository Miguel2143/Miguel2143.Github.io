		<h2>Francisco Goya Black Paintings</h2>

		<img src="Goya.jpg">

		<p>These Francisco Goya paintings are referred to officially as "Black Paintings". These paintings often depicted dark images with moribd curiousity leaking from the artists brush. The painting above is of Titan Cronus whom the Romans referred to as "Saturn" devouring his son because of his fear of the prophecy by Gaea. This painting emits so much emotion with such limited movement and tells a tragic story. </p>
