		<h2>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</h2>

		<p>Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a 1970s film. This film sparked an immense feeling in me and was unfortuantely partially based on a true story. The film in short is about a group of teenagers trying to settle down in their fathers old home. While in search of the house they come across what looks to be in abandoned house. However to their surprise a serial murderous family lives within and the main antagonist "leatherface" wears a mask made of his victims face trying to continuously pursue the protagonists.</p>
